# Car Price Prediction Using TensorFlow
**Overview**

This project involves building a linear regression model to predict car prices based on features such as mileage, horsepower, and more. The model was developed using TensorFlow and optimized for performance using TensorFlow and optimized for performance using normalization and Adam optimizer.

**Key Features**

* **Data Preprocessing**              : Load and prepare the data for training by checking forn null values and visualizing feature relationships using pairplots.
* **Train / Validation / Test Split** : Data was split into 80% training, 10% validation, 10% test sets.
* **Model Architecture**              : A simple linear regression model with a normalization layer and a fully connected layer(Hidden Layer).
* **Training**                        : The model was trained using Mean Absolute Error(MAE) loss function and Adam Optimizer.
* **Performance Metrics**             : The model was evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE).
